    <a href="https://www.aiaa.org/dbf" target="_blank"> AIAA DBF </a> is an RC aircraft design competition. I am currently the Computer Aided Desing Lead, meaning I oversee all of our Computer Aided Design, design many components of the aircraft, instruct new members in SolidWorks software, and finalize the CAD drawings package for the final design report.
